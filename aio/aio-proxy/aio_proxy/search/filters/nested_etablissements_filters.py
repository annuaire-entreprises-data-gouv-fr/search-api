    """Filter search by matching an id in an array of ids,

                  "id_finess",
                  "id_rge",

    The parameters concerned by this function are bool variables that have a
    `TRUE` value when they exist, and are not indexed (in elasticsearch) when the
    value is missing, which is equivalent to having a `FALSE` value.
    e.g "convention_collective_renseignee",
        "est_finess",
        "est_uai",
        "est_entrepreneur_spectacle",
        "est_rge",
    In order to keep the elasticsearch index light, when the value is present for
    these variables, we index `TRUE`, and when the value is missing (meaning it's
    False), we do not index the value `FALSE`, we simply leave it empty.
    Instead, we use this function to filter these values, based on whether a
    value was indexed.
    Having a value equals >> TRUE and not having an indexed value equals >> FALSE.
    We use the "exists" elasticsearch filter to implement it."""
